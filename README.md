# Reactive-Colors
My first React.JS project after the codeacademy tutorial.

The assignment was to:

Using react's standard features, no animation libraries, create a component that contains many colored boxes in a grid. When any box is clicked, change the color of the boxes in a ripple pattern outward from the clicked box. (You will have to either use requestAnimationFrame or additively precompute a transition style to every box.)

Example of the ripple effect to be created: https://codepen.io/mistkaes/pen/EjQzxy
